This repository contains a demonstration of [general linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model), with a particular emphasis on multiple regression. The [`penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) dataset from the [`palmerpenguins`](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/)` package in R, containing measurements of penguin species inhabiting the [Palmer Archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Archipelago), is used. The dataset was originally introduced by Gorman et al. ([2014](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090081))

The report is available [here](https://danielvartan.github.io/linear-model/).
